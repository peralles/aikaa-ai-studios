- **Impact**: Medium - Full audit trail not captured  
- **Recommendation**: Enhance T059 to include field-level change tracking

### 📊 Coverage Metrics
- **Total Requirements**: 60
- **Fully Covered**: 58 (97%)
- **Partially Covered**: 0 (0%)
- **Not Covered**: 2 (3%)
- **Coverage Score**: **97% - EXCELLENT**

## 2. Consistency Analysis

### ✅ Perfect Consistency Areas

**Entity Alignment** (spec.md ↔ data-model.md ↔ tasks.md):
- All 10 entities from spec.md appear in data-model.md ✅
- All entities have corresponding creation tasks (T025-T035) ✅
- Field definitions match across all documents ✅
- Relationships properly mapped ✅

**API Contract Alignment** (spec.md ↔ contracts/api.yaml ↔ tasks.md):
- All 36 endpoints from contracts match functional requirements ✅
- Contract tests (T008-T018) cover critical API paths ✅
- Controller tasks (T046-T055) implement all endpoint groups ✅
- HTTP methods and status codes consistent ✅

**Architecture Consistency** (plan.md ↔ tasks.md):
- 2-module structure (Core + Workflows) maintained ✅
- Constitutional requirements enforced throughout ✅
- File paths in tasks match plan.md structure ✅
- Service dependencies properly sequenced ✅

### ⚠️ Minor Inconsistencies (3 found)

**Issue #1: ActivePieces Integration Depth**
- **spec.md**: "Advanced workflow orchestration with retry logic"
- **tasks.md**: T041 mentions retry logic but not detailed implementation
- **Severity**: Minor
- **Fix**: Add retry configuration details to T041 description

**Issue #2: CLI Interface Scope**
- **plan.md**: "CLI interface required for observability and operational tasks"
- **tasks.md**: T066 lacks specific operational command examples
- **Severity**: Minor
- **Fix**: Specify CLI commands (health check, migrate, seed data) in T066

**Issue #3: Performance Testing Granularity**
- **plan.md**: "30,000+ requests/second with Fastify adapter"
- **tasks.md**: T074 mentions load testing but no specific target verification
- **Severity**: Minor
- **Fix**: Add specific 30k req/sec validation to T074

## 3. Constitutional Compliance Review

### ✅ Full Compliance Achieved

**Three Services Maximum**: ✅ **COMPLIANT**
- plan.md: "Single NestJS backend service with exactly two modules"
- tasks.md: T063 (CoreModule) + T064 (WorkflowsModule) = 2 modules
- No additional service creation tasks present

**Direct Technology Integration**: ✅ **COMPLIANT**
- plan.md: "Direct NestJS + Supabase integration without wrapper layers"
- tasks.md: Services directly use Supabase client (T036-T045)
- No abstraction layer tasks present

**Test-First Development**: ✅ **COMPLIANT**
- tasks.md: "⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.4" (tests before implementation)
- Clear sequence: T008-T024 (tests) → T025+ (implementation)
- "CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation"

**CLI Interface Required**: ✅ **COMPLIANT**
- plan.md: "CLI interface required for observability"
- tasks.md: T066 "CLI interface with operational commands"

**Structured Logging**: ✅ **COMPLIANT**
- plan.md: "NestJS structured logging with ActivePieces workflow tracking"
- tasks.md: T059 "Structured logging interceptor with correlation IDs"

**No Over-Engineering**: ✅ **COMPLIANT**
- Removed analytics module (merged into Core)
- Removed junction tables (use JSON arrays)
- Simplified contract testing approach
- Direct Supabase integration without abstractions

## 4. Task Sequence Analysis

### ✅ Well-Structured Dependencies

**Critical Path Analysis**:
```
Setup (T001-T004) → Database (T005-T007) → Tests (T008-T024) → Implementation (T025+)
```

**Proper Blocking Dependencies**:
- T041 (ActivePieces service) → T042 (workflow execution) ✅
- T043 (Kanban service) → T051-T053 (Kanban controllers) ✅
- T025-T035 (entities) → T036-T045 (services) ✅
- T036-T045 (services) → T046-T055 (controllers) ✅

**Parallel Execution Optimization**:
- Phase 3.3: 11 contract tests can run in parallel ✅
- Phase 3.4: 11 entity files can run in parallel ✅
- Phase 3.5: Most services can run in parallel ✅
- Proper [P] markers for independent tasks ✅

### ⚠️ Minor Sequencing Issues (1 found)

**Issue #4: Database Indexes Timing**
- T007 creates indexes but services aren't implemented yet
- **Recommendation**: Move index creation after service layer (after T045)
- **Impact**: Low - doesn't break functionality

## 5. Technical Consistency

### ✅ Technology Stack Alignment

**Backend Framework**:
- spec.md: "NestJS backend with TypeScript"
- plan.md: "Node.js 18+ with TypeScript 5.0+ + NestJS"
- tasks.md: T001 "Create NestJS project with TypeScript 5.0+"
- **Status**: ✅ Perfectly aligned

**Database & Auth**:
- spec.md: "Supabase for database and authentication"
- plan.md: "Supabase (PostgreSQL/Auth/Storage)"
- tasks.md: T002 "Initialize Supabase project"
- **Status**: ✅ Perfectly aligned

**External Integrations**:
- spec.md: "ActivePieces workflow automation"
- plan.md: "ActivePieces REST API"
- tasks.md: T041 "ActivePiecesService with HTTP client"
- **Status**: ✅ Perfectly aligned

**Performance Requirements**:
- spec.md: "High-performance backend"
- plan.md: "30,000+ requests/second with Fastify adapter"
- tasks.md: T071 "Performance tuning for 30k+ req/sec target"
- **Status**: ✅ Perfectly aligned
