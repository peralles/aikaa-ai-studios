## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A Platform Admin sets up a new Parent Company (tenant) in the system, creates associated subsidiary companies, configures user roles and permissions, and establishes Studios (Kanban workflows) to manage business processes like lead tracking, sales opportunities, and project management across the entire corporate hierarchy.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Platform Admin is logged in, **When** they create a new Parent Company with subsidiaries, **Then** the system creates isolated tenant spaces with proper data segregation
2. **Given** a Company Admin is managing their organization, **When** they create a new Studio for lead management, **Then** the system enforces that Studio can only manage Lead-type cards
3. **Given** a Normal User has access to multiple companies, **When** they switch between company contexts, **Then** they see only the Studios and Cards relevant to each company
4. **Given** users are collaborating on Cards in a Studio, **When** they move cards between Kanban columns, **Then** the system updates the card status and maintains workflow integrity

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user loses access to a company while actively working on cards?
- How does the system handle Parent Company deletion when subsidiaries exist?
- What occurs when two users simultaneously move the same card to different columns?
- How are data conflicts resolved when companies are merged or restructured?
